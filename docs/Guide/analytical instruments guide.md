# Installation

## Magritek Spinsolve NMR

The instrument installation must follow the official Spinsolve Manual. To install the flow probe for liquid connection to the ChemPU, use only official Spinsolve Glass Flow Cell (Product code `SPGFC`) with corresponding connection kit (SPGFCFIT), otherwise the leakproof is not guaranteed! The connection kit supplied by Magritek is designed for continuous flow installation using a peristaltic pump and therefore is excessive for ChemPU installation. Only the following parts are needed:

- 2x Idex P-135 - threaded adapter.
- 2x Idex XP-132 - 3/16" (or 4.0 mm) OD tubing fitting; with P-133 Flangeless Ferrule (included).
- 2x Idex XP-235 - Flangeless fitting for 1/16" OD tubing, short; with P-200 Ferrule (included).

Install your fittings as shown below. Ensure all fittings are finger-tight to prevent leaking.
